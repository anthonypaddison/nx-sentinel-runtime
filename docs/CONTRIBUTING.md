## Formatting
- Follow existing style and indentation (4 spaces, no tabs).
- Prefer small, focused functions and modules.
- Avoid introducing non-ASCII unless the file already uses it.

## Notes
- Keep UI strings in plain ASCII for reliability.
- Use the helper modules under `config/www/nx-displaygrid/` for new features.
