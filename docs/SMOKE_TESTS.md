# Smoke Tests

Run these quick checks after changes to ensure core flows still work.

1) Load the Family Board dashboard and confirm the schedule renders.
2) Add a calendar event via the add dialog and confirm it appears.
3) Edit an existing event and confirm the change persists.
4) Mark a chore complete and confirm it updates (and repeats, if configured).
5) Add a shopping item and confirm quantities update.
6) Open Settings and verify preferences save (slot minutes, day range, theme).
7) Toggle mobile layout on a phone-sized viewport and confirm the layout switches.
